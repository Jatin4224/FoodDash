//react testing libraries

-install
https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/

-react testing library is already integrated in create react app.

-React testing library needs -> jest (javascript testing framework )
https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

- install
  npm i -D jest

whenever we use jest with babel we have to install some additional dependencies.

- install
  npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env

//now this depependies conflict with babel and parcel.
because parcel already uses babel inside it.

-we have to change parcels behaviour we have to make some changes in the parcel.
-read parcel documentation->javascript->babel part

by creating .parcelrc file and
codee -
{
"extends": "@parcel/config-default",
"transformers": {
"\*.{js,mjs,jsx,cjs,ts,tsx}": [
"@parcel/transformer-js",
"@parcel/transformer-react-refresh-wrap"
]
}
}

-ommand to run test cases
npm run test
